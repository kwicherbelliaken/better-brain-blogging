### Architecture

I use Notion as my content management system (CMS). Each blog post is created as a page, and these pages are organized as entries in a database.

All kudos for the landing page animation goes to Mike Bostock and his [Metaball Animation](https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/metaballs). I thought it looked coool so I stole it!

### Influences / References

- https://dev.to/martenstijs/how-we-used-notion-as-a-cms-for-our-blog-5b63: I used this to process the JSON Notion Page Block content as it seemed a good means of interpreting the Notion response payload.

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/notion-to-md: I was originally going to use this inside the $braindumpId loader and then process the returned Markdown into HTML using some interpreter. Fortunately, Notion chose against returning queried against resources as Markdown for JSON.
